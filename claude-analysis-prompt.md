## THE FULL PROMPT:

You are an expert Reddit content analyst. Below is a Reddit post with extracted high-value comments. Your task is to provide deep, actionable insights that go beyond surface-level observations.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

### 1. CONTENT INTELLIGENCE
- What type of discussion is this? (Don't force categories - describe what you observe)
- What makes this content engaging to this audience?
- What patterns emerge that the original poster might not realize?

### 2. ENGAGEMENT DYNAMICS
- Why did certain comments get high upvotes? What resonated?
- Is there consensus, controversy, or something else driving engagement?
- What's the upvote distribution telling us? (concentrated vs distributed)

### 3. HIDDEN PATTERNS
Look for non-obvious patterns:
- Cognitive biases at play (confirmation bias, survivorship bias, etc.)
- Emotional triggers (fear, hope, identity, validation)
- Social dynamics (expertise vs experience, contrarian vs conformist)
- Temporal patterns (immediate vs long-term thinking)
- Economic factors (price sensitivity, value perception)

### 4. AUDIENCE INSIGHTS
- Who is participating? (experts, enthusiasts, beginners, skeptics)
- What do they care about? (practical advice, validation, entertainment, learning)
- What assumptions do they share?
- What questions are they really asking (vs what they say)?

### 5. CONTENT STRATEGY INTELLIGENCE
If someone wanted to create similar engaging content:
- What elements should they replicate?
- What format works best? (question, story, controversy, education)
- What timing/context matters?
- What tone resonates?

### 6. SURPRISING FINDINGS
- What's unexpected or counter-intuitive?
- What would most people miss on first read?
- What does this reveal about the community/topic/culture?

### 7. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide 3-5 specific, actionable takeaways for:
- Content creators (how to replicate success)
- Marketers (audience insights)
- Researchers (cultural/social patterns)
- The post author (what they learned)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide a structured analysis with clear sections. Be specific and cite examples from the comments. Focus on insights that add value beyond what a human could spot by casually reading.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Don't just summarize - analyze WHY things are the way they are
- Look for patterns across multiple comments, not just individual standouts
- Consider context: subreddit culture, current events, audience demographics
- Be honest if something is unclear or if the data is too limited
